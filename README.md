# ISCo3D

## Overview
**ISCo3D** is a multi-modal dataset designed for 3D object detection tasks in complex real-world environments, specifically focusing on autonomous driving and construction scenarios.  
The dataset provides synchronized LiDAR point clouds and RGB camera images to support research and development of robust 3D perception algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Data**: Includes high-resolution LiDAR scans and corresponding camera images.
- **Challenging Environments**: Captures both urban driving scenes and dynamic construction sites.
- **3D Detection Annotations**: Provides 3D bounding boxes for a variety of object categories commonly encountered in autonomous driving and construction.
